Javascript Callbacks
===================
A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function
Callbacks allows a function to call another function
A callback function can run after another function has finished
Asynchronous Javascript
======================
Functions running in parallel with other functions are called asynchronous

Javascript Promises
==================
In Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations.
They are easy to manage when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations.
It is idel for handling asynchronous operations in the simple manner.
They can handle mulitple asynchronous operations easily
They can provide better error handling than callbacks and events.

Benifits or Promises
=================
1.impoves code readabilty.
2.better handling of asynchronous operations
3.Better error-handling
4.Better flow of control definisation of asynchronous logic

A Promise has four states:
1.fulfilled:Action related to the promise succeeded.
2.rejected:Action related to the promise is failed
3.pending:Promise is still pending i.e not fulfilled or rejected yet.
4.settled:Promise had fullfilled or rejected

//declaration
var promise=new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
//do something
});
Parameters
=======
1.Promise constructor takes only one argument,a callback fucntion
2.callback function takes two arguments,resolve and reject.
3.Perform operations inside the callback function and if everything went well then call resolve.
4.If something went wrong then call reject.
